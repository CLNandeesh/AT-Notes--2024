Variables and Data Types
========================
->To Store data we use variables and to specify what type of data we are storing in the variables then we need to use Data types. 
->It is used for memory allocation. 

Primitive Data type
-------------------
->-2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) -1
->If exceeds the range then Compiler will throw an error.
->Default data type for whole number, Java consider is int, If we are performing any operation on 2 or more numbers then the result data is by default is int data type.
->Default data type for float number, Java consider is double, If we are performing any operation on 2 or more numbers then the result data is by default is double data type.
->Bases on UTF, Unicode representation above memory representation.

byte
1 byte of memory is allocated
Default Value: 0
Ex:
byte b=22;

short
2 byte of memory is allocated
Default Value: 0
Ex:
short s=33;

char
2 bytes of memory is allocated
Ex: 
char c='A'; //A
char c=65; //A

int
4 bytes of memory is allocated
Default Value: 0
Ex:
int i=345;

long
8 bytes of memory is allocated
Default Value: 0
Ex: 
long l=3456l;
long l=12345L;

float
4 bytes of memory is allocated
Default Value: 0.0
7 digit precession
Ex:
float f=12.3f;
float f=23.44F;

double
8 bytes of memory is allocated
Default Value: 0.0
14 digit precession
Ex:
double f=12.3;
double f=23.44;

Boolean
1 bit of memory is allocated
Default Value: false
Ex:
Boolean
