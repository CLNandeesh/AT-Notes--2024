Features
========
Simple/Object Oriented/Platform Independent/Portable/Robust/Secure/Interpreted/Multi Threaded

Source code[.java]>Byte code[.class file][JVM understandable code]

Execution of Java code
=======================
Compiler: Converts .java file to .class file at once during compilation time.
JVM: Translates .class file to native specific code[based on OS] and execute[JIT] it line by line during runtime.[Interpreter]

JDK VS JRE VS JVM
=================
JDK: Tool kit having both JRE and JVM
JRE: Run time env to execute Java program
JVM: Used to execute Java program
     
Memory in JVM
Stack
Heap
Method
Register

Stable version of JDK:21
Company: Open JDK or Oracle JDK

Main method
===========
Entry point for the program, recognized and exe by JVM.
JVM identify main having standard syntax
Class without main method cannot be executed
static public allowed
main method can be overloaded

Keywords and Identifiers
========================
Keywords: Reserve words which has pre defined functionality and can be used in the programs.
Ex: for int char

Identifiers: Name given to variables, methods, class, interface, ....
Rules:
Starts with Letters or _ or $
No Keywords can be used
Can contain letters, digits, _ and $
No space, can be used _
Meaning full

Variables and Data types
=========================
Containers to store the values
Type of data
 Primitive: Cannot be broken
       Bolen Types: boolean
       Numeric
          Integral: byte[1], short[2], int[4], long[8], char[2]
          Floating point: float[4], double[8]
 Non Primitive: Can be broken
          Class[String], Interface, Enum, Annotation type

0b/0O/0X

Variable Types
Local/Instance/Static

Constants
=========
final int a=100; //Value cannot be changed

Operators
=========
Assignment Operator: =
Compound Assignment Operator:a=a+10; a+=10;
Unary Operator:- +
Arithmetic Operator:+ - * / %
Relational Operator:> < <= >= == != !
Logical Operator: ! || &&
Equality operator: == !=
Bitwise Operator: | & 
Ternary Operator: ?:
Inc and Dec Operator: ++ --

Ternary Operator
int large=(40>20)?40:20;

byte>short>int>long>float>double
           char

Type Casting
============
Converting data of one type to another type
Type checking is done by Compiler at compilation time, Type casting is done by JVM at runtime

Primitive data type casting
Implicit[widening]: Internally done by JVM at run time
Explicit[narrowing]: Need to do manually using cast operator
int a=100;
byte b=(byte) a;

String
======
Sequence of characters
Immutable in nature, new object will be created to store modified content if we modify existing content

String str="appu"; //SCP
String str=new String("appu"); //Heap and SCP, In SCP no duplicate allowed

str.toLower("")/str.toUpper("")/str.chatAt(index)

String s1=new String ("Appu"); //Heap[Allow duplciates] and SCP
String s2="Appu"; //SCP , No Duplicates

Ex: No Duplicates allowed in SCP
String s1="appu";
String s2="appu";
s1==s2 //true
s1.equals(s2); //true
One object storing appu and both s1 s2 points to it

Ex: Duplicates allowed in Heap
String s1=new String("appu");
String s2="new String("appu");
s1==s2 //false
s1.equals(s2); //true
Two object will be created and s1 and s2 points to its respective memory location

Ex:== Ref value comparision, equals is used for content compariaion

Ex:
        String s1="Appu";
        System.out.println(s1);
        System.out.println(s1.hashCode());
        s1.concat("raj");
        System.out.println(s1);
        System.out.println(s1.hashCode());
        s1=s1.concat("raj"); //new obj is created to store modified content
        System.out.println(s1);
        System.out.println(s1.hashCode());

OUTPUT:
Appu
2047636
Appu
2047636
Appuraj
871694599
